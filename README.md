# Hashing Project
This project demonstrates various hashing techniques implemented in Java. The project includes implementations of different hash tables, such as linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing, and more. The goal of this project is to explore different collision resolution strategies in hash tables, compare their performance, and highlight their unique characteristics.

# Project Structure
DoubleHashTable.java: Implements a hash table that uses double hashing for collision resolution.
LinearHashTable.java: Implements a hash table using linear probing to handle collisions.
QuadHashTable.java: Implements a hash table that resolves collisions using quadratic probing.
Machine.java: Contains the logic for simulating or managing hash table operations and interfacing with the different hash tables.
myHashingProject.java: The main driver class for executing the hashing project, managing the interactions, and comparing the different hashing techniques.
Features
Multiple Collision Resolution Techniques: The project showcases various methods like linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.
Efficient Lookup and Insertions: Optimized for time complexity when handling large datasets.
Custom Hash Functions: Custom hash functions have been implemented for each technique to demonstrate how different strategies work in practice.
Machine Simulation: Manages and runs the hashing operations, providing a structured way to test the performance of each technique.
